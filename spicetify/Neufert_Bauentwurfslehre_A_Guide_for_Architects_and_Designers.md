It shows how to combine functionality, efficiency and aesthetics in various building contexts and challenges. It is a book that every architect and designer should have in their library.

The Neufert Bauentwurfslehre has a long and rich history that spans over eight decades. The book was born out of the experience and vision of Ernst Neufert, a German architect who studied and worked with Walter Gropius, the founder of the Bauhaus school. Neufert was influenced by the Bauhaus principles of rationality, functionality and standardization, and applied them to his teaching and practice.
 
Neufert taught at the Bauhochschule Weimar, where he developed his lectures on building design and construction. He collected and organized various data and information on dimensions, proportions, materials, building types and regulations, and compiled them into a handbook that he intended to use for his students. However, he soon realized that his handbook could be useful for a wider audience of architects and designers, and decided to publish it as a book in 1936.
 
The book was an instant success and became a bestseller in Germany and abroad. It was praised for its clarity, comprehensiveness and usefulness. It was also criticized for its rigidity, uniformity and lack of creativity. Nevertheless, the book established itself as a standard reference for architecture and design, and influenced generations of architects and designers around the world.
